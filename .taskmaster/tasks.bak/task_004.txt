# Task ID: 4
# Title: Implement User Authentication and Meeting History Interface
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a user authentication system with registration/login functionality and implement a meeting history list interface to allow users to access their past transcriptions and summaries.
# Details:
1. **User Authentication System**:
   - Implement a secure authentication backend using FastAPI:
     - Create user model with fields for username, email, password (hashed), and creation date
     - Set up database tables for user data using SQLAlchemy ORM
     - Implement password hashing using bcrypt or Passlib
     - Create API endpoints for user registration, login, and password reset
     - Implement JWT token-based authentication with proper expiration and refresh mechanisms
   - Develop frontend authentication components:
     - Create registration form with validation for username, email, and password
     - Build login form with error handling for invalid credentials
     - Implement protected routes using React Router
     - Add user session management with token storage in localStorage or cookies
     - Create user profile page with basic account management options

2. **Meeting History Interface**:
   - Backend implementation:
     - Design database schema for storing meeting metadata (title, date, duration, language)
     - Create API endpoints for listing, retrieving, updating, and deleting meeting records
     - Implement filtering and pagination for meeting history
     - Add relationship between users and meetings for proper access control
   - Frontend implementation:
     - Create a responsive meeting history list component with sorting options
     - Implement meeting card components showing key information (title, date, duration)
     - Add search and filter functionality by date, title, or content
     - Create detailed view for each meeting with options to replay audio, view transcript, and see summary
     - Implement delete and export functionality for meeting records

3. **Integration with Existing Components**:
   - Modify the transcription workflow to associate new transcriptions with the logged-in user
   - Update the audio player component to load from the meeting history
   - Ensure the transcript viewer and summary components work with the meeting history data
   - Implement proper error handling and loading states throughout the application

4. **Security Considerations**:
   - Implement CSRF protection
   - Add rate limiting for authentication endpoints
   - Ensure proper validation of all user inputs
   - Set up secure HTTP headers
   - Implement proper error logging without exposing sensitive information

# Test Strategy:
1. **Unit Testing**:
   - Test user model and database operations:
     - Verify user creation, retrieval, update, and deletion
     - Test password hashing and verification
     - Validate email uniqueness constraints
   - Test authentication endpoints:
     - Verify registration with valid and invalid data
     - Test login with correct and incorrect credentials
     - Validate JWT token generation and verification
   - Test meeting history API endpoints:
     - Verify CRUD operations for meeting records
     - Test filtering and pagination functionality
     - Validate user-specific data isolation

2. **Integration Testing**:
   - Test the complete authentication flow from registration to protected route access
   - Verify meeting creation and association with the correct user
   - Test the meeting history retrieval and display in the frontend
   - Validate that only authorized users can access their own meeting data

3. **UI Testing**:
   - Test form validation for registration and login forms
   - Verify error messages are displayed appropriately
   - Test responsive design of the meeting history interface
   - Validate sorting, filtering, and pagination of the meeting list
   - Test navigation between meeting list and detailed meeting view

4. **Security Testing**:
   - Perform penetration testing on authentication endpoints
   - Test for common vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS, CSRF)
   - Verify token expiration and refresh mechanisms
   - Test rate limiting functionality

5. **User Acceptance Testing**:
   - Create test scenarios for typical user workflows:
     - New user registration and first meeting recording
     - Returning user login and accessing previous meetings
     - Searching and filtering meeting history
   - Gather feedback on usability of the authentication and history interfaces
